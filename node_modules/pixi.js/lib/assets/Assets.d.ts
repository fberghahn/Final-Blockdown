 * A one stop shop for all Pixi resource management!
 * Super modern and easy to use, with enough flexibility to customize and do what you need!
 * @namespace assets
 *
 * Use the singleton class [Assets]{@link assets.Assets} to easily load and manage all your assets.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Assets, Texture } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * const bunnyTexture = await Assets.load<Texture>('bunny.png');
 * const sprite = new Sprite(bunnyTexture);
 * ```
 *
 * Check out the sections below for more information on how to deal with assets.
 *
 * <details id="assets-loading">
 *
 * <summary>Asset Loading</summary>
 *
 * Do not be afraid to load things multiple times - under the hood, it will **NEVER** load anything more than once.
 *
 * *For example:*
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Assets } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * promise1 = Assets.load('bunny.png')
 * promise2 = Assets.load('bunny.png')
 *
 * // promise1 === promise2
 * ```
 *
 * Here both promises will be the same. Once resolved... Forever resolved! It makes for really easy resource management!
 *
 * Out of the box Pixi supports the following files:
 * - Textures (**_avif_**, **_webp_**, **_png_**, **_jpg_**, **_gif_**, **_svg_**) via {@link assets.loadTextures}, {@link assets.loadSvg}
 * - Video Textures (**_mp4_**, **_m4v_**, **_webm_**, **_ogg_**, **_ogv_**, **_h264_**, **_avi_**, **_mov_**) via {@link assets.loadVideoTextures}
 * - Sprite sheets (**_json_**) via {@link assets.spritesheetAsset}
 * - Bitmap fonts (**_xml_**, **_fnt_**, **_txt_**) via {@link assets.loadBitmapFont}
 * - Web fonts (**_ttf_**, **_woff_**, **_woff2_**) via {@link assets.loadWebFont}
 * - JSON files (**_json_**) via {@link assets.loadJson}
 * - Text Files (**_txt_**) via {@link assets.loadTxt}
 * <br/>
 * More types can be added fairly easily by creating additional {@link assets.LoaderParser LoaderParsers}.
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="textures">
 *
 * <summary>Textures</summary>
 *
 * - Textures are loaded as ImageBitmap on a worker thread where possible. Leading to much less janky load + parse times.
 * - By default, we will prefer to load AVIF and WebP image files if you specify them.
 * But if the browser doesn't support AVIF or WebP we will fall back to png and jpg.
 * - Textures can also be accessed via `Texture.from()` (see {@link core.from|Texture.from})
 * and now use this asset manager under the hood!
 * - Don't worry if you set preferences for textures that don't exist
 * (for example you prefer 2x resolutions images but only 1x is available for that texture,
 * the Assets manager will pick that up as a fallback automatically)
 *
 * #### Sprite sheets
 * - It's hard to know what resolution a sprite sheet is without loading it first, to address this
 * there is a naming convention we have added that will let Pixi understand the image format and resolution
 * of the spritesheet via its file name: `my-spritesheet{resolution}.{imageFormat}.json`
 * <br><br>For example:
 *   - `my-spritesheet@2x.webp.json`* // 2x resolution, WebP sprite sheet*
 *   - `my-spritesheet@0.5x.png.json`* // 0.5x resolution, png sprite sheet*
 * - This is optional! You can just load a sprite sheet as normal.
 * This is only useful if you have a bunch of different res / formatted spritesheets.
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="fonts">
 *
 * <summary>Fonts</summary>
 *
 * Web fonts will be loaded with all weights.
 * It is possible to load only specific weights by doing the following:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Assets } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * // Load specific weights..
 * await Assets.load({
 *     data: {
 *         weights: ['normal'], // Only loads the weight
 *     },
 *     src: `outfit.woff2`,
 * });
 *
 * // Load everything...
 * await Assets.load(`outfit.woff2`);
 * ```
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="background-loading">
 *
 * <summary>Background Loading</summary>
 *
 * Background loading will load stuff for you passively behind the scenes. To minimize jank,
 * it will only load one asset at a time. As soon as a developer calls `Assets.load(...)` the
 * background loader is paused and requested assets are loaded as a priority.
 * Don't worry if something is in there that's already loaded, it will just get skipped!
 *
 * You still need to call `Assets.load(...)` to get an asset that has been loaded in the background.
 * It's just that this promise will resolve instantly if the asset
 * has already been loaded.
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="manifests-and-bundles">
 *
 * <summary>Manifest and Bundles</summary>
 *
 * - {@link assets.AssetsManifest Manifest} is a descriptor that contains a list of all assets and their properties.
 * - {@link assets.AssetsBundle Bundles} are a way to group assets together.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Assets } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * // Manifest Example
 * const manifest = {
 *     bundles: [
 *         {
 *             name: 'load-screen',
 *             assets: [
 *                 {
 *                     alias: 'background',
 *                     src: 'sunset.png',
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     alias: 'bar',
 *                     src: 'load-bar.{png,webp}',
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: 'game-screen',
 *             assets: [
 *                 {
 *                     alias: 'character',
 *                     src: 'robot.png',
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     alias: 'enemy',
 *                     src: 'bad-guy.png',
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     ]
 * };
 *
 * await Assets.init({ manifest });
 *
 * // Load a bundle...
 * loadScreenAssets = await Assets.loadBundle('load-screen');
 * // Load another bundle...
