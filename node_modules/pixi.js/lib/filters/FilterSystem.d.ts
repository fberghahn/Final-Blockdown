/**
 * The filter pipeline is responsible for applying filters scene items!
 *
 * KNOWN BUGS:
 * 1. Global bounds calculation is incorrect if it is used when flip flopping filters. The maths can be found below
 * eg: filters [noiseFilter, blurFilter] noiseFilter will calculate the global bounds incorrectly.
 *
 * 2. RenderGroups do not work with filters. This is because the renderGroup matrix is not currently taken into account.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * 1. Gotcha - nesting filters that require blending will not work correctly. This creates a chicken and egg problem
 * the complexity and performance required to do this is not worth it i feel.. but lets see if others agree!
 *
 * 2. Filters are designed to be changed on the fly, this is means that changing filter information each frame will
 * not trigger an instruction rebuild. If you are constantly turning a filter on and off.. its therefore better to set
 * enabled to true or false on the filter. Or setting an empty array.
 *
 * 3. Need to look at perhaps aliasing when flip flopping filters. Really we should only need to antialias the FIRST
 * Texture we render too. The rest can be non aliased. This might help performance.
 * Currently we flip flop with an antialiased texture if antialiasing is enabled on the filter.
