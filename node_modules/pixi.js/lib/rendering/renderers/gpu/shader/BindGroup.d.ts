/**
 * A bind group is a collection of resources that are bound together for use by a shader.
 * They are essentially a wrapper for the WebGPU BindGroup class. But with the added bonus
 * that WebGL can also work with them.
 * @see https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dictdef-gpubindgroupdescriptor
 * @example
 * // Create a bind group with a single texture and sampler
 * const bindGroup = new BindGroup({
 *    uTexture: texture.source,
 *    uTexture: texture.style,
 * });
 *
 * Bind groups resources must implement the {@link BindResource} interface.
 * The following resources are supported:
 * - {@link TextureSource}
 * - {@link TextureStyle}
 * - {@link Buffer}
 * - {@link BufferResource}
 * - {@link UniformGroup}
 *
 * The keys in the bind group must correspond to the names of the resources in the GPU program.
 *
 * This bind group class will also watch for changes in its resources ensuring that the changes
 * are reflected in the WebGPU BindGroup.
