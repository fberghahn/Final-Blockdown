/**
 * A wrapper for a WebGPU Program, specifically designed for the WebGPU renderer.
 * This class facilitates the creation and management of shader code that integrates with the WebGPU pipeline.
 *
 * To leverage the full capabilities of this class, familiarity with WGSL shaders is recommended.
 * @see https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#index
 * @example
 *
 * // Create a new program
 * const program = new GpuProgram({
 *   vertex: {
 *    source: '...',
 *    entryPoint: 'main',
 *   },
 *   fragment:{
 *    source: '...',
 *    entryPoint: 'main',
 *   },
 * });
 *
 *
 * Note: Both fragment and vertex shader sources can coexist within a single WGSL source file
 * this can make things a bit simpler.
 *
 * For optimal usage and best performance, it help to reuse programs whenever possible.
 * The {@link GpuProgram.from} helper function is designed for this purpose, utilizing an
 * internal cache to efficiently manage and retrieve program instances.
 * By leveraging this function, you can significantly reduce overhead and enhance the performance of your rendering pipeline.
 *
 * An important distinction between WebGL and WebGPU regarding program data retrieval:
 * While WebGL allows extraction of program information directly from its compiled state,
 * WebGPU does not offer such a capability. Therefore, in the context of WebGPU, we're required
 * to manually extract the program layout information from the source code itself.
