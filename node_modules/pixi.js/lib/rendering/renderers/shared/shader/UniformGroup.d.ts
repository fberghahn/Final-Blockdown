 * Uniform group holds uniform map and some ID's for work
 *
 * `UniformGroup` has two modes:
 *
 * 1: Normal mode
 * Normal mode will upload the uniforms with individual function calls as required. This is the default mode
 * for WebGL rendering.
 *
 * 2: Uniform buffer mode
 * This mode will treat the uniforms as a uniform buffer. You can pass in either a buffer that you manually handle, or
 * or a generic object that PixiJS will automatically map to a buffer for you.
 * For maximum benefits, make Ubo UniformGroups static, and only update them each frame.
 * This is the only way uniforms can be used with WebGPU.
 *
 * Rules of UBOs:
 * - UBOs only work with WebGL2, so make sure you have a fallback!
 * - Only floats are supported (including vec[2,3,4], mat[2,3,4])
 * - Samplers cannot be used in ubo's (a GPU limitation)
 * - You must ensure that the object you pass in exactly matches in the shader ubo structure.
 * Otherwise, weirdness will ensue!
 * - The name of the ubo object added to the group must match exactly the name of the ubo in the shader.
 *
 * When declaring your uniform options, you ust parse in the value and the type of the uniform.
 * The types correspond to the WebGPU types {@link UNIFORM_TYPES}
 *
 Uniforms can be modified via the classes 'uniforms' property. It will contain all the uniforms declared in the constructor.
 *
 * ```glsl
 * // UBO in shader:
 * uniform myCoolData { // Declaring a UBO...
 *     mat4 uCoolMatrix;
 *     float uFloatyMcFloatFace;
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * // A new Uniform Buffer Object...
 * const myCoolData = new UniformGroup({
 *     uCoolMatrix: {value:new Matrix(), type: 'mat4<f32>'},
 *     uFloatyMcFloatFace: {value:23, type: 'f32'},
 * }}
 *
 * // modify the data
 * myCoolData.uniforms.uFloatyMcFloatFace = 42;
 * // Build a shader...
 * const shader = Shader.from(srcVert, srcFrag, {
 *     myCoolData // Name matches the UBO name in the shader. Will be processed accordingly.
 * })
 *
 *
