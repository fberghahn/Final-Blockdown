 * A texture stores the information that represents an image or part of an image.

 * loading mechanisms.
 *
 * The Assets class can be used to load an texture from a file. This is the recommended
 * way as it will handle the loading and caching for you.
 *
 * ```js
 *
 * const texture = await Asset.load('assets/image.png');
 *
 * // once Assets has loaded the image it will be available via the from method
 * const sameTexture = Texture.from('assets/image.png');
 * // another way to acces the texture once loaded
 * const sameAgainTexture = Asset.get('assets/image.png');
 *
 * const sprite1 = new Sprite(texture);
 *
 * ```
 *
 * It cannot be added to the display list directly; instead use it as the texture for a Sprite.
 * If no frame is provided for a texture, then the whole image is used.
 *
 * You can directly create a texture from an image and then reuse it multiple times like this :
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Sprite, Texture } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * const texture = await Asset.load('assets/image.png');
 * const sprite1 = new Sprite(texture);
 * const sprite2 = new Sprite(texture);
 * ```
 *
 * If you didn't pass the texture frame to constructor, it enables `noFrame` mode:
 * it subscribes on baseTexture events, it automatically resizes at the same time as baseTexture.
