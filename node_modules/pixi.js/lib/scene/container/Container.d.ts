/**
 * Container is a general-purpose display object that holds children. It also adds built-in support for advanced
 * rendering features like masking and filtering.
 *
 * It is the base class of all display objects that act as a container for other objects, including Graphics
 * and Sprite.
 *
 * <details id="transforms">
 *
 * <summary>Transforms</summary>
 *
 * The [transform]{@link scene.Container#transform} of a display object describes the projection from its
 * local coordinate space to its parent's local coordinate space. The following properties are derived
 * from the transform:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <thead>
 *     <tr>
 *       <th>Property</th>
 *       <th>Description</th>
 *     </tr>
 *   </thead>
 *   <tbody>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[pivot]{@link scene.Container#pivot}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Invariant under rotation, scaling, and skewing. The projection of into the parent's space of the pivot
 *         is equal to position, regardless of the other three transformations. In other words, It is the center of
 *         rotation, scaling, and skewing.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[position]{@link scene.Container#position}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Translation. This is the position of the [pivot]{@link scene.Container#pivot} in the parent's local
 *         space. The default value of the pivot is the origin (0,0). If the top-left corner of your display object
 *         is (0,0) in its local space, then the position will be its top-left corner in the parent's local space.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[scale]{@link scene.Container#scale}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Scaling. This will stretch (or compress) the display object's projection. The scale factors are along the
 *         local coordinate axes. In other words, the display object is scaled before rotated or skewed. The center
 *         of scaling is the [pivot]{@link scene.Container#pivot}.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[rotation]{@link scene.Container#rotation}</td>
 *       <td>
 *          Rotation. This will rotate the display object's projection by this angle (in radians).
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[skew]{@link scene.Container#skew}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         <p>Skewing. This can be used to deform a rectangular display object into a parallelogram.</p>
 *         <p>
 *         In PixiJS, skew has a slightly different behaviour than the conventional meaning. It can be
 *         thought of the net rotation applied to the coordinate axes (separately). For example, if "skew.x" is
 *         ⍺ and "skew.y" is β, then the line x = 0 will be rotated by ⍺ (y = -x*cot⍺) and the line y = 0 will be
 *         rotated by β (y = x*tanβ). A line y = x*tanϴ (i.e. a line at angle ϴ to the x-axis in local-space) will
 *         be rotated by an angle between ⍺ and β.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         It can be observed that if skew is applied equally to both axes, then it will be equivalent to applying
 *         a rotation. Indeed, if "skew.x" = -ϴ and "skew.y" = ϴ, it will produce an equivalent of "rotation" = ϴ.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         Another quite interesting observation is that "skew.x", "skew.y", rotation are commutative operations. Indeed,
 *         because rotation is essentially a careful combination of the two.
 *         </p>
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[angle]{@link scene.Container#angle}</td>
 *       <td>Rotation. This is an alias for [rotation]{@link scene.Container#rotation}, but in degrees.</td>
 *     </tr>

 *         the "requested" width by the local bounding box width. It is indirectly an abstraction over scale.x, and there
 *         is no concept of user-defined width.

 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="alpha">
 * <summary>Alpha</summary>
 *
 * This alpha sets a display object's **relative opacity** w.r.t its parent. For example, if the alpha of a display
 * object is 0.5 and its parent's alpha is 0.5, then it will be rendered with 25% opacity (assuming alpha is not
 * applied on any ancestor further up the chain).
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="visible">
 * <summary>Renderable vs Visible</summary>
 *
 * The `renderable` and `visible` properties can be used to prevent a display object from being rendered to the
 * screen. However, there is a subtle difference between the two. When using `renderable`, the transforms  of the display
 * object (and its children subtree) will continue to be calculated. When using `visible`, the transforms will not
 * be calculated.
 * ```ts
 * import { BlurFilter, Container, Graphics, Sprite } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * const container = new Container();
 * const sprite = Sprite.from('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/693612/IaUrttj.png');
 *
 * sprite.width = 512;
 * sprite.height = 512;
 *
 * // Adds a sprite as a child to this container. As a result, the sprite will be rendered whenever the container
 * // is rendered.
 * container.addChild(sprite);
 *
 * // Blurs whatever is rendered by the container
 * container.filters = [new BlurFilter()];
 *
 * // Only the contents within a circle at the center should be rendered onto the screen.
 * container.mask = new Graphics()
 *     .beginFill(0xffffff)
 *     .drawCircle(sprite.width / 2, sprite.height / 2, Math.min(sprite.width, sprite.height) / 2)
 *     .endFill();
 * ```
 *
 * </details>
 *
 * <details id="renderGroup">
 * <summary>RenderGroup</summary>
 *
 * In PixiJS v8, containers can be set to operate in 'render group mode',
 * transforming them into entities akin to a stage in traditional rendering paradigms.
 * A render group is a root renderable entity, similar to a container,
 * but it's rendered in a separate pass with its own unique set of rendering instructions.
 * This approach enhances rendering efficiency and organization, particularly in complex scenes.
 *
 * You can enable render group mode on any container using container.enableRenderGroup()
 * or by initializing a new container with the render group property set to true (new Container({isRenderGroup: true})).
 *  The method you choose depends on your specific use case and setup requirements.
 *
 * An important aspect of PixiJS’s rendering process is the automatic treatment of rendered scenes as render groups.
 * This conversion streamlines the rendering process, but understanding when and how this happens is crucial
 * to fully leverage its benefits.
 *
 * One of the key advantages of using render groups is the performance efficiency in moving them. Since transformations
 *  are applied at the GPU level, moving a render group, even one with complex and numerous children,
 * doesn't require recalculating the rendering instructions or performing transformations on each child.
 * This makes operations like panning a large game world incredibly efficient.
 *
 * However, it's crucial to note that render groups do not batch together.
 * This means that turning every container into a render group could actually slow things down,
 * as each render group is processed separately. It's best to use render groups judiciously, at a broader level,
 * rather than on a per-child basis.
 * This approach ensures you get the performance benefits without overburdening the rendering process.
 *
 * RenderGroups maintain their own set of rendering instructions,
 * ensuring that changes or updates within a render group don't affect the rendering
 * instructions of its parent or other render groups.
 *  This isolation ensures more stable and predictable rendering behavior.
 *
 * Additionally, renderGroups can be nested, allowing for powerful options in organizing different aspects of your scene.
 * This feature is particularly beneficial for separating complex game graphics from UI elements,
 * enabling intricate and efficient scene management in complex applications.
 *
 * This means that Containers have 3 levels of matrix to be mindful of:
 *
 * 1. localTransform, this is the transform of the container based on its own properties
 * 2. groupTransform, this it the transform of the container relative to the renderGroup it belongs too
 * 3. worldTransform, this is the transform of the container relative to the Scene being rendered
