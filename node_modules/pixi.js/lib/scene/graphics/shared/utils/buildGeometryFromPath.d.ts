/**
 * When building a mesh, it helps to leverage the simple API we have in `GraphicsPath` as it can often be easier to
 * to define the geometry in a more human readable way. This function takes a `GraphicsPath` and returns a `MeshGeometry`.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 *
 * const path = new GraphicsPath()
 *    .drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100)
 *
 * const geometry:MeshGeometry = buildGeometryFromPath(path);
 *
 * const mesh = new Mesh({geometry});
 *
 * ```
 * You can also pass in a Matrix to transform the uvs as by defualt you may want to control how they are set up.
 * @param options - either a `GraphicsPath` or `GeometryPathOptions`
 * @returns a new `MeshGeometry` instance build from the path
