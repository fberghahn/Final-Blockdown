            <h2>Abstract Bachelor thesis</h2>

            <p>In view of the growing importance of distributed systems, the diverse use of multimedia content on different devices, and the ongoing development of browsers, the relevance of investigating the potential of cross-device browser games becomes clear.</p>

            <p>The aim of this work is to iterate the prototype of the game <strong>Finalblockdown</strong>, developed in the previous practical project, through a participatory process and ultimately publish it as open-source software. The direct involvement of selected test users in the iteration of the game aims to improve the gaming experience, technical performance, and user-friendliness in an extensive and user-oriented manner.</p>

            <p>To execute the participatory process, several focus groups were formed, which were actively involved throughout the entire development process by testing and evaluating each iteration in detail. The test runs were a combination of play-testing and group interviews, which were recorded for evaluation. Based on the documented, collected, and categorized feedback from all groups, a development plan was created for the respective iteration.</p>

            <p>The participatory process brought significant benefits, particularly with regard to the design of the user interface, game mechanics, and testing. However, limitations due to limited time and resources show that the participatory approach is time-consuming, which must be taken into account in the process planning.</p>

            <p>Through the process, a visually and playfully convincing game was developed that implemented complex programming concepts such as websockets, WebGL graphics, and spatial hashing in vanilla JavaScript and was published through self-hosting. Nevertheless, the system still has extensive potential for optimization and development, which is why it is well suited as open-source software and will through this be further developed beyond the scope of the project.</p>

            <p>Further research could focus on both process-related and technical aspects. Further development of the participatory process could analyse how the involvement of test users in complex areas of development, including system architecture and performance, could enhance the democratization of design. Technical investigations could focus on how optimizations in the areas of hosting, websockets, and collision detection can contribute to improving the performance of the system.</p>
